# Learning Human Viewpoint Preferences from Sparsely Annotated Models
We provide the first deep learning approach to learn the human viewpoint preference directly from annotated data. Moreover, we provide several designs to compute such metrics in a few milliseconds enabling its use in real-time applications.
